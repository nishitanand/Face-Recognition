# Face Recognition

This program is used for face recognition.
We have used Numpy, Pandas and OpenCV.
In this project I have used OpenCV to get video input from Front Camera in Face_Collect.py
Then I used Haarcascade Face Classifier to identify faces. It saves the face section region till we hit "q" on the keyboard and saves it as a .npy file.

Then Face_Recognition.py
